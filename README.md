# Customer Churn Prediction – ML Inference API

An end-to-end machine learning inference system for predicting customer churn.
The project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model, expose it as a
REST API using FastAPI, and deploy it in a reproducible way using Docker.

---

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline (data preprocessing → model training → inference)
- Trained classification model using scikit-learn
- FastAPI-based REST API for real-time predictions
- Input validation using Pydantic schemas
- Fully containerized with Docker for portability and reproducibility

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn prediction is a common real-world machine learning problem.
Given customer attributes such as credit score, age, balance, and activity
status, the system predicts whether a customer is likely to churn.

## ▶️ Running the Application (Docker)

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running

### Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t churn-ml-api .
```
Run the container
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 churn-ml-api
```

```
Example Request:
```
{
  "credit_score": 600,
  "age": 40,
  "tenure": 3,
  "balance": 60000,
  "products_number": 2,
  "credit_card": 1,
  "active_member": 1,
  "estimated_salary": 50000,

  "country_Spain": 1,
  "gender_Male": 1
}
```
Example Response:
```

  "churn_prediction": 0
}
```
📌 Notes
The model is trained offline and loaded at application startup
Focuses on inference & deployment, not model tuning
Designed to demonstrate production-style ML system design
